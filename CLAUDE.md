- 3 & 4 is incorrect. I need you to not download this from a repo but how & what I need to do to create this app from scratch (A - Z), starting with environment setup. Also, before we do that I need the project to do the following to the app and make sure it works first:  Input/Output

Inputs:
Text field where we expect values 0 - 9
Push button
Pop button
Quit button

Outputs:
Read only textbox shall display the content of the stack and also if it’s full or if it’s empty
Textbox shall display errors and exceptions

CAN YOU DO THIS?
